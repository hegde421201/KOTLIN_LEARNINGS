UNIT TESTING
------------

A unit test is a piece of code written by a software programmer to test certain functionality of code
The class to be tested is called class under test.
The function to be tested is called function under test.

Unit testing provides feedback to the programmer whether the classes/functions that have been written are correct or not.

Unit testing instantiates the class under test,executes the function under test and verifies whether it works as expected.

How JUnit works ?
------------------

JUnit has a runner which determines the tests, executes those tests, and reports the results.
Junit test validates expected result with actual output from the code under test.
Thus based on assertions success or failure it provides feedback to the programmer.

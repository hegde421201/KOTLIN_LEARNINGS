Model View Controller (MVC) pattern
------------------------------------

Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the program logic into three interconnected elements. 
This is done to separate internal representations of information, from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.

An easy way to understand MVC: the model is the data, the view is the window on the screen, and the controller is the glue between the two.

Concept
Using this pattern, we separate the user interface 
logic from the business logic and decouple the major components in such a way that they can be reused efficiently. 
This approach promotes parallel development.
From the definition, it is apparent that the pattern consists of these major components: model, view, and controller. 
The controller is placed between the view and model in such a way that they can communicate to each other only through the controller. 
This model separates the mechanism of how the data is displayed from the mechanism of how the data will be manipulated.
The diagram below shows a typical MVC pattern.
